# stm32f103c8-board

Quick demo board made with Eagle and working with GCC G++ OpenCM3 Makefile FreeRTOS CAN


This project runs FreeRTOS 8.2.1 with OpenCM3  through STM32F103C8, a cheap ARM 32bits Cortex M3, in a custom board designed with Eagle 7.

_I forgot to add an CH340G for USB <-> Serial programming_


## STM32F103RB6

It also contains a port of FreeRTOS 8.2.1 with OpenCM3 and C++ support for cheap eBay boards with STM32F103RB6 and LCD screens like http://hackaday.com/2012/11/07/developing-with-ebay-sourced-arm-lcd-dev-boards/

Mine came named as MINI-STM32-V3 and a label with www.openmcu.com, a 2.8" TFT LCD Rev2.


Zizzle http://zizzle-brewbot.blogspot.com.es/2012/10/stm32-lcd-touch-screen-demo.html has done a better work with FreeRTOS 7 and Eclipse.
